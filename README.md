# Mafia
A game created for Intro to Programming, CSCI 1330, using Python.
Also used as an experiment with graphics in a program.

Based on the game Mafia, this program puts you in the position of a villager in a town that has secret mafia members in it.
Each night, mafia members kill 1 fellow townsperson. After that, you can use a clue to guess who might be in the mafia.
If you guess correctly, you can win, but if you guess incorrectly, you kill an innocent and make it easier for mafia to get to you.
